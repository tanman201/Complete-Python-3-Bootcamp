# Game PlayÂ¶
# To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:
#
# Create a deck of 52 cards
# Shuffle the deck
# Ask the Player for their bet
# Make sure that the Player's bet does not exceed their available chips
# Deal two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player
# Show only one of the Dealer's cards, the other remains hidden
# Show both of the Player's cards
# Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card
# If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.
# If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17
# Determine the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly
# Ask the Player if they'd like to play again
